Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
 Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
 Software – Quartus prime


## Theory
Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical functions on one or more inputs to produce one output.
#### OR Gate:
The OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that operates on two binary inputs, producing an output of 1 if at least one input is 1. It symbolizes logical disjunction and is essential in building logical circuits and decision-making processes in computers and electronics.
#### AND Gate:
The AND gate is a fundamental digital logic gate with two inputs and one output. It produces a high output (1) only when both input signals are high (1). If any input is low (0), the output remains low. It's a building block for more complex logic circuits and is integral in digital computations.
#### NOT Gate:
The NOT gate is a fundamental digital logic gate. It has a single input and a single output. The output is the inverse of the input: if the input is high (1), the output is low (0), and vice versa. It's a basic building block in digital circuits, used for logic inversion.
